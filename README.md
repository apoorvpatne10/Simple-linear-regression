# Simple-linear-regression-model
A simple model to predict salaries of employees based on a sample csv file dataset. This will be done by firstly splitting the existing dataset into training set and test set. We'll then visualize the training set and test set results by plotting the observation points along with the linear plot of predicted points which is a straight line.
