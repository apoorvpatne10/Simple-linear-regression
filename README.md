# Simple-linear-regression-model
A simple model to predict salaries of employees based on a sample csv file dataset. This will be done by firstly splitting the existing dataset into training set and test set. We'll then visualize the training set and test set results by plotting the observation points along with the linear plot of predicted points which is a straight line.
Simulation of the solution has been done on both python and R.

## Initial setup

Run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Get started 

Type the following command and goto http://localhost:8000 on your browser

```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Live demo
